[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/PineappleIOnic/NeonNetwork/badges/master/pipeline.svg)]

NeonNetwork was an attempt at an social media
  - Built on a scaleable interface
  - Powered by Django

### Tech

NeonNetwork uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course NeonNetwork itself is open-source with a [public repository](https://github.com/PineappleIOnic/NeonNetwork_Public) on GitHub.

### Installation

NeonNetwork requires [Python](ttps://www.python.org/downloads/) v3+ to run.

Install the pipenv (if you don't have it).

```sh
$ cd NeonNetwork
$ pip install pipenv
```
then run the initialize_source.bat on windows.

for linux enviroments use virtualenv within the directory.
